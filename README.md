### Objective Of The Project
- A German banking institution needs to conduct a risk analysis by understanding the loan applicant’s profiles whenever the bank receives any loan application. The bank has to make a decision regarding whether there is a risk of ‘Bad credit’ or not.


### What is the need of this analysis?
- Credit Risk is the probable risk of loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. If a bank offers credit to its client, then there is a risk that the clients may not pay their invoices.
- So, by performing analysis on this dataset the aim is to gather patterns and insights that can help the bank to minimize financial loss and maximize profit.
- To minimize loss the bank needs a decision rule regarding whom to give approval of the loan and whom not to. 


### What is explored?
- Performed data-driven analysis to discover the profile of customers who are likely to turn out as 'Bad credit' for the business.
- An applicant’s demographic and socio-economic profiles have been considered so that the loan managers can take decision regarding a loan application approval processing.


### Technical Aspect
